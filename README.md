# Nexus – Behaviour-Based News Personalization (Privacy-First)

**Nexus** is an innovative web app that redefines news delivery by offering **personalized content without collecting demographic data** (age, gender, location, etc.), addressing key concerns around **privacy** and **algorithmic bias**.

## 🔒 Privacy-First Personalization

Unlike traditional news platforms that rely on identity data, Nexus uses **real-time behavioural signals**:

- 📜 Scroll depth  
- ⏱️ Dwell time  
- 🖱️ Clicks  
- 🔄 Shares  

These are used to build an **anonymous, content-based suggestion algorithm**, ensuring equitable and inclusive personalization without profiling users.

## 😌 Anonymous Mood Mode

A standout feature, **Anonymous Mood Mode**, leverages lightweight ML to:

- Detect emotional cues from user behaviour (e.g., skipping heavy stories)
- Dynamically adjust the tone of content for a more comfortable, empathetic experience

This helps mitigate **echo chambers** and **stereotyping**, fostering **diverse and balanced news consumption**.

## 🌍 Accessibility & Offline Support

Nexus is designed with accessibility in mind:

- 📴 **Offline reading and behaviour tracking**
- 🔄 Content and activity data **sync automatically when reconnected**
- 📲 Ideal for **low-connectivity regions**

## 🎥 Unified Multimedia Feed

Nexus integrates:

- 📰 Articles  
- 🎬 Videos  
- 🐦 Social media posts (e.g., X posts)

All content is **prioritized by user engagement behaviour**, not by who the user is.

## 🤔 Transparent Recommendations

- 📌 **“Why This Story?”** feature provides contextual explanations for each recommendation  
- 🧠 Builds trust through **algorithm transparency**

## 📈 Advanced Features

- 🎯 **Taste Graph**: Visualizes evolving content preferences  
- 📝 **Dynamic Summaries**: AI-generated content digests, tailored to reading habits
